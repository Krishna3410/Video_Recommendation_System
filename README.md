# Video_Recommendation_System
#This project implements a video recommendation system that leverages content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and a hybrid model to provide personalized video recommendations. The system dynamically suggests videos based on user interactions, preferences, and engagement data.

#The project includes a Flask-based API and web application to serve recommendations and evaluate their performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

#Features
 Fetch and preprocess data from APIs to create user interaction and video metadata datasets.
 Content-Based Filtering: Recommends videos based on video metadata (e.g., category, title).
 Collaborative Filtering: Leverages user interaction data to recommend videos based on similar user preferences.
 Hybrid Model: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for improved accuracy.
 Flask-based API endpoints to serve recommendations in JSON format.
 Web interface for users to view recommendations dynamically.
 Evaluation using MAE and RMSE.
